# Medieval Dice Game [Scrimba Module 7 Project]

This is a vanilla javascript project I built taking the Frontend Career Path at Scrimba.
Languages: Javascript, HTML, CSS

I Had lots of fun building this project and I learnt a lot as well. Here's a couple of things I learnt:

- How to destructure objects as well as mapping over arrays.
- The Array constructor, and how to chain methods together.
- I also learned how to use constructor functions and `Object.assign` method to assign properties to objects.
- How to use the `this` keyword to refer to the current object.
- Importing and exporting modules in Javascript.
- How to use the `.reduce()` method to iterate over an array.
- How to use the ternary operator to conditionally execute code.
- How to write super concise functions with arrow functions.
- I learnt about classes and how to use them to create objects.
